## Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
The Azure Resource Manager is at the core of the Azure platform and is used to deploy and manage Azure services. Every resource in Azure managed under ARM can be described and managed in a consistent way. It's very helpful to understand the Azure Resource Manager and how to work with Resource Groups.
> Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources: Resource Manager and classic. Microsoft recommends that most new deployments use the Resource Manager model.
